We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to **make their
papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**.

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of
the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience
for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It’s imperative to note that **ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to
criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial
scientific activity in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and
valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research
community as a whole.

-----

## **Two ways to get involved:**

### **[Nominate a paper](https://link-to-submissionform)**

We invite nominations for papers that have both associated **code** and
**data** publicly available. We also encourage analyses based on open
source tools as we cannot guarantee participants will have access to
specialised licenced software.

projects**](https://youraccount.shinyapps.io/reprohack-awesome-conf)

### [**REGISTER as a participant**](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reprohack-nl-tickets-73258469053)

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about
**reproducibility**, working with **other people’s code and data** and
more\!
