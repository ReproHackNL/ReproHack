# ReproHack

📅 30 November 2019
🌍 Leiden, the Netherlands

We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to make their papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data.

We know how challenging it can be so we want to showcase the value of the practice, both for original authors and as a learning experience for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It’s imperative to note that ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to criticise or discredit work. We see reproduction as beneficial scientific activity in itself, with useful outcomes for authors and valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research community as a whole.

There are two ways to get involved:

👉 Nominate your paper: let other people reproduce your paper!

👉 On the day
